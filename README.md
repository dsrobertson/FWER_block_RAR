# FWER_block_RAR

Code for the paper **Familywise error rate control for block response-adaptive randomization** (2022),
available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05734

Use the file **typeI_control_sim.R** in either the *two_treatments* or *three_treatments* folder to run the simulations for two or three experimental treatment arms, respectively (correspond to Tables 3 and 4 in the paper). The file **weights_example.R** in the *two_treatments* folder reproduces the example weights given in Tables 1 and 2. Finally, the file **trial_example.R** in the *two_treatments* folder reproduces Table 5.
